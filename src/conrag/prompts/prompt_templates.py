    Extract explicit graph facts from a passage for retrieval.

    # Instructions
    - Use `schema` as the preferred label set; create new labels only when needed.
    - Use only facts stated in `passage`; do not infer.
    - Preserve passage entity names; merge entities only when the passage clearly treats them as identical.
    - Split dense passages into separate facts.
    - Put relations in directed triples: subject, relation, object.
    - Put literal values in attributes, including dates, roles, locations, genres, counts, awards, occupations, nationalities, and categories.
    - Include every entity referenced by triples or attributes in `entities`.
    - Keep labels concise and retrieval-friendly.

    # Output Format

    - `acquired_information`: concise facts explicitly stated in `evidence`; no inference.
    - Do not answer directly. `plan` must be non-empty.
    - Plan only for missing facts or facts that need verification needed to answer `question`.
    - Preserve the target slot, entity constraints, comparisons, and yes/no/all/both conditions.
    - Use the fewest retrieval-oriented steps; resolve bridge entities before dependent facts.
    - Make `sub_question` self-contained except for `<dep:ID>` placeholders.
    - Use zero-based contiguous ids; dependencies must be earlier ids.

    - Return the shortest grounded value that answers `sub_question`.
    - If one entity or value is requested, return one entity or value, not a list.
